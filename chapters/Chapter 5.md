**Chapter 5**

Ed: Soooooo… we didn’t just imagine all that, did we?

Jordan: No, I don’t think so.

Ed: And this isn’t a dream is it?

Blake: I’m afraid not.

\*A comical shot of the trio catching their breath and sweating\*

Ed: Hey, why are you two breathless? What happened to all that spunk you had just now?

Jordan: Adrenaline went down.

Blake: I was bluffing.

Ed: But weren’t you the one who wanted to come here in the first place?

Blake: I didn’t think we’d find anything\!

Ed: What?\!

Jordan: Alright everyone, calm down\! Panicking won’t get us anywhere\!

Blake: You’re right.

Jordan: Let’s review everything that happened just now. We came to this school at night to find some “thing”, that “thing” turned out to be a magician who can control demons, and now that magician has captured yet another student and challenged us to a duel. Did I get all that right?

Blake: Yeah, that sounds about right.

Jordan: WHAT THE FUCK\!?

Ed: Didn’t you just tell us not to panic?

Jordan: HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO NOT PANIC?\!

Blake: Alright shut up\! Everyone shut up\!... Let’s at least get the fuck out of here\!

Both: right\!

\*Outside the school\*

Jordan: What should we do? Should we contact the police?

Blake: Oh yeah, like they’re gonna believe we saw a demon-riding man shooting flames at us\! Besides, Lily already tried that\! Don’t you remember?

Ed: Yeah. I say… I say we just ditch this. It’s a miracle we got out of this in the first place\!

Blake: So you just want to abandon Lily and all our other classmates?

Ed: Well I don’t WANT to, but…

Jordan: He said he would be waiting for us to duel him one month from now. How does he expect us to do that? I mean, it’s not like there are books that teach you how to do magick\!

Ed: Weeeeeell, technically, there are.

Jordan and Blake: What?

Ed: Yeah. They’re called “grimoires”. We could probably find some at our library. But those books can’t possibly be real\! I think… I mean, I’ve never tried them…

\*The trio looks at each other\*

Blake: Well, the library’s gotta be closed by now, so… Tomorrow after school, let’s all meet up at the library\!

Jordan: Right\!

Ed: Oh ok…

\*An overhead shot of the library with text saying “the next day”\*

\*We then jump cut to the trio at the library shifting through books\*

Jordan: What book are we looking for again?

Ed: The Simon Necronomicon \*he says while holding his phone on one hand\*

Jordan: How do you know this book is the real deal?

Ed: I… don’t…

Jordan: You don’t?

Ed: Nope. I found it on a top 10 list of grimoires just now.

Jordan: Great… that doesn’t spark much confidence…

Blake: No, it does not… but it’s our only lead, so we’ll take it. Aha\! The Simon Necronomicon\!

\*cut to a shot of the trio at a table opening the book\*

Ed: In the mid 1920s, roughly two blocks from where the Warlock Shop once stood, in Brooklyn Heights, lived a quiet, reclusive man, an author of short stories, who eventually divorced his wife of two years and returned to his boyhood home in Rhode Island, where he lived with his two aunts. Born in August 20, 1890, Howard Phillips Lovecraft- LOVECRAFT?\! That’s my last name\!

Blake: Hey, you’re right\!

Elias: Oho\! Blake, Ed, and Jordan? Surprised to see you three at the library\!

All: Mr Gardner?

Jordan: What are you doing here?

Elias: Oh I’m just picking up some books, you know, for my class. Hmmm? What do you got there?

Ed: This? Uhhhh \*he says slightly embarrassed\*

Elias: Ohohoho the Simon Necronomicon\! So you're those kinds of kids huh? Interested in magick? The occult?

Ed: Uhhh well I wouldn’t exactly say that-

Elias: Ohh don’t get embarrassed now. There’s nothing wrong with a healthy obsession with the occult.

Blake: You know about this book? \*he says seeing his demeanor slightly suspicious\*

Elias: Why yes\! I used to own a copy myself\!

Blake: Really?

Elias: Mhmm. I may or may not have dabbled in the occult myself.

Blake: Then, what can you tell us about this book?

Elias: Well it’s a very famous grimoire from the 1970s. It was marketed as the “real necronomicon”, which is a fictional grimoire that often appeared on HP Lovecraft’s stories. Because of this, that grimoire is a bit divisive, often disregarded as nonsense by many so-called “real magicians”.

Blake: Huh? Really? So then... it's fake…

Elias: Maybe it is… or maybe it’s not\! Maybe Simon made it all up, or, maybe Simon really did have access to occult knowledge no one else did. Maybe the book was dictated to him from a divine being. Or maybe Simon himself spread the rumors that the book was fake so only those worthy would be curious enough to try out the spells. The only way you could know for sure is if you try, right? That’s the thrill of the occult, trying out new things to see if they work\!

\*The trio get filled with determination due to Elias’ inspirational words\*

Elias: Well, I’ll leave you magicians to it. Good luck with your magical journey\! But please don’t forget to study for my class too\!

\*Elias walks away\*
