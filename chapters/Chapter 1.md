# **Chapter 1 - How The Journey Begins Pt 1**

## Scene 1

**Scene begins showing an overhead shot of the school. There will be text saying Keweenoskey High - First Day of Senior Year.**

**Blake and Jordan are standing on the entrance waiting for Ed to arrive**
Blake: There he is!
Ed: hey
Blake: Well, this is it guys, senior year! We gotta make sure we don't fuck this up!
Ed: Yeah Jordan, you better not fuck this up!
Jordan: Huh? Why you calling me out, Ed? I plan on making this the most legendary year yet!
Ed: Legendary? You mean like how you got in detention last year for breaking the vending machine?
Jordan: Hey! That thing ate my money! Right Blake? You were there!
Blake: Yes, I was. And it's because I was there that I also got in detention!
Jordan: Yeah, well, we ride together, we die together!

## Scene 2
**Scene opens up in the classroom**
**All the students are talking.**
**The teacher, Rose, then walks in.**
Rose: Excuse me!
**No one listens**
**Rose gets mad**
Rose: EXCUSE ME!
**Still no one listens**
**Rose grabs a ruler and slams it so hard against her desk it breaks**
Blake: Argh! I could sue you for child abuse!
Rose: Heh, not anymore! You’re 18 now, legally considered a fully grown adult!
Blake: *Grrrr*
Rose: *sigh* now that I have your attention, I have some news to share. As I'm sure you've all heard, students from our school have been disappearing as of recently, and well, one of the students from our classroom has been the most recent one to go missing. You all know the student Harper, right? Well, she’s in this class. However, for the past 48 hours she’s been missing.
**The classroom starts whispering to each other**
Jordan: Harper? The delinquent girl with daddy issues? She probably just killed herself!
**Entire classroom starts laughing.**
Rose: SHUT UP! As I was saying. The police are conducting an investigation, but if any of you have any clues as to what happened to her, or any of the other students, please cooperate with the police.
**Rose notices Lily looking suspicious**
Rose: Lily? I see you’re a bit worked up. Do you know something?
**Lily looks flustered and can’t say anything coherent**
**Rose mockingly repeats the jarbled mess Lily is saying**
Rose: What does that mean Lily??? Can't you speak English?!
Blake: Come on Lily, spill it! Where’d you hide the body?
**The entire classroom starts laughing**
**Lily gets up crying and runs away from the classroom**
Rose: Hey! Where do you think you're going?!
**Rose runs after her**
Blake: Oooooooooh... maybe I went too far... *he says cringing*

## Scene 3
**Scene 3 opens with the trio walking through the school's hallways**
Blake: Dude, I went too far with that joke.
Ed: Ah don't worry about it. Everyone in the classroom laughed!
Blake: Yeah but I realized something at that exact milisecond when I saw Lily running out of the classroom crying. Jokes can hurt people! So from now on, I have to be responsible with the kind of jokes I make!
Jordan: Ohoooooh! Wow! Look at you! You're a changed man now aren't you? All grown up? Ready to leave your childish ways behind? *laughs at Blake's comment*
Ed: Seems oddly convinient that you JUST came to that conclusion the second you saw the effects your jokes could have!
Blake: Yeah, well, at least I changed! Unlike you guys who's sense of humor hasn't evolved past the 6th grade!
**Trio stays silent for a panel**
Ed: ... "where'd you hide the body?"
**Ed and Jordan start laughing**
**Blake is trying to hold in his laughter**
Blake: Stoooooooooop! You're making me look hypocritical!
Jordan: Hey, do you guys hear that?
Blake: Yeah, I think it’s coming from that direction
**The trio walk to the source of the strange sound**
**Upon arriving, they find Lily crying by herself**
All at once: Lily?
**Lily looks up and sees the trio standing before her**
**Blake makes a face of regret, thinking his joke is what caused her to cry**
Blake: Uhhh, are you crying because of my dumb joke? I-I’m sorry about that, I didn’t mean-
Lily: No, it’s not that… I… I know what happened to Harper!
