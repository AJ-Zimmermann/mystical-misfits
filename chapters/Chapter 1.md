# **Chapter 1 - How The Journey Begins Pt 1**

## Scene 1

**The story begins on the last day of summer. The trio is at Blake’s house playing video games.**\
**Blake and Jordan grunt while Ed laughs**

Ed: looks like I win! And since that was the last game-

Jordan: NO! One more! The last one for real!

Ed: Heh, you must really enjoy losing! Ok then Jordan, the last one for real!

**They resume playing their game**\
**The scene then cuts to the trio standing outside the house on Blake’s front lawn**

Jordan: I’m beating you next time, Ed!

Ed: Yeah, that’s what you always say.

Jordan: What was that?

Ed: I said, yeah, that’s what you always say. Do you need me to say it again?-

**Blake grabs both of them by their shoulder**

Blake: Don’t start fighting right now guys.

Ed: You ok Blake?

Blake: I don’t know. I guess I’m a bit melancholic. I mean, this was our last day of summer as high schoolers. Doesn’t that make you kinda sad?

**Ed and Jordan mellow down and look at each other**

Ed and Jordan: … yeah

Blake: Just one more year and this chapter of our lives will be over. I mean, school is basically all we’ve ever known, and now it’s ending. It’s all happening so fast.

## Scene 2

\*Next scene begins showing an overhead shot of their school, then cutting to the classroom.\*
\*All the students are talking.\*
\*The teacher, Rose, then walks in.\*
Rose: Excuse me\!
\*No one listens\*
\*Rose gets mad\*
Rose: EXCUSE ME\!
\*Still no one listens\*
\*Rose grabs a ruler and slams it so hard against her desk it breaks\*
Blake: Argh\! I could sue you for child abuse\!
Rose: Heh, not anymore\! You’re 18 now, legally considered a fully grown adult\!
Blake: \*Grrrr\*
Rose: \*sigh\* now that I have your attention, I have some unfortunate news to share. Some of you may have heard of the recent disappearances of our students, and well, one of the students from our classroom has been the most recent one. You all know the student Harper, right? Well, she’s a part of this class. However, for the past 48 hours she’s been missing.
\*The classroom starts whispering to each other\*
Jordan: Harper? The delinquent girl with daddy issues? She probably just killed herself.
\*Entire classroom stays silent, staring at Jordan\*
Rose: Yeah, I thought that too…
\*Entire classroom now stares at Rose\*
Rose: But she’s not the only student who went missing. Over the past week, four other students went missing too.
\*Entire classroom starts talking and whispering again\*
Rose: SHUT UP\! As I was saying. The police are conducting an investigation. But if any of you have any clues as to what happened to them, please, speak up.
\*Rose notices Lily looking suspicious\*
Rose: Lily? I see you’re a bit worked up. Do you know something?
\*Lily looks flustered and can’t say anything coherent\*
Ed: Come on Lily, spill it\! Where’d you hide the body? HEHEH\! Heheh… heh… S-Sorry…
Rose: So you don’t have anything?
\*Lily shakes her head\*
Rose: \*sigh\* alright then.

\*Next scene opens with a close-up of the school bell\*
\*The trio are walking through the hallways, with Ed mad at his two friends\*
Ed: You guys had me looking like a fool back there\! When I say a dumb joke, you’re supposed to laugh so that I don’t look like a fool\!
Blake: That wasn’t an appropriate time to make that joke, Ed\!
Jordan: Yeah Ed\! If we had laughed, then we would’ve looked like fools\!
Ed: Wha-?\! But you made that joke about Harper killing herself\!
Jordan: That wasn’t a joke, that was just saying what everyone was thinking. And besides, no one laughed when I said that either.
Ed: \*sigh\* yeah, that’s true.
Blake: Hey, do you guys hear that?
Ed: Yeah, I think it’s coming from that direction
\*The trio walk to the source of the strange sound\*
\*Upon arriving, they find Lily crying by herself\*
All at once: Lily?
\*Lily looks up and sees the trio standing before her\*
\*Ed makes a face of regret, thinking his joke is what caused her to cry\*
Ed: Uhhh, are you crying because of my dumb joke? I-I’m sorry about that, I didn’t mean-
Lily: No, it’s not that… I… I know what happened to Harper\!
