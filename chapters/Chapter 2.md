**Chapter 2 \- Whispers of the Haunted Challenge**

In this chapter, the trio discovers Lily crying alone. Concerned, they ask her what's troubling her. Lily reveals that she knows what happened to Harper. She explains that rumors have been circulating on social media about the school being haunted, leading to a challenge where students must enter the school alone at night to prove their bravery. The recent disappearances of students who attempted this challenge have only increased its popularity. Lily recounts how she heard Harper screaming for help but was too frightened to enter the school on her own. Instead, she ran home and informed her parents, who then contacted the police. However, when the police searched the school, they found nothing, and Harper was subsequently reported missing. After hearing Lily's story, the trio agrees to meet with her later that night to enter the school and investigate for themselves. The chapter concludes with the trio and Lily gathering in front of the school.

Blake: You know what happened to Harper? Then, why did you say you didn’t know anything when Ms Rose asked?

Lily: Because… she wouldn't believe me\!

\*The trio looks at her for a few seconds before Jordan breaks the silence\*

Jordan: I’d believe you\!

Blake: Yeah, we’d believe you\!

Ed: Well… it depends on what she says-

\*Jordan and Blake both hit Ed in the head\*

Jordan and Blake: Shut up\!

Ed: Ow\!

\*Lily sniffs and agrees to tell them what she knows\*

Lily: Ok… \*sigh\* Here’s what happened. You all know the stories about our school being haunted? Well, around a month ago, a challenge started spreading on social media to visit our school at night. 

Jordan: Oh yeah, I think I heard about that.

Lily: Well, as soon as people started doing this challenge, something else started to happen, our classmates started disappearing\!

\*The trio looks surprised\*

Lily: The disappearances happening so close with the challenge has only helped fuel the popularity. And well, you know how Harper is. As soon as she heard about this challenge, she wanted to try it. Two days ago, we both came here at 1 AM. We were going to enter the school together, but… I just… couldn’t… 

Blake: Why not?

Lily: I don’t know… I could just sense something within it, something evil, something… that isn’t usually here... I tried to convince Harper that we shouldn’t go in, but she insisted on doing the challenge. She said she’d go in by herself if I didn’t join her, so she did. And then… after a few minutes… it happened\! I heard Harper screaming for help\!

\*The trio gets shocked\*

Lily: She was screaming my name\! She wanted me to go in and help her\! But I… I… I WAS TOO AFRAID TO GO IN\!

Jordan: Have you told anyone?

Lily: I did\! I told my parents\! But you know… they don’t like Harper very much, in fact they always tell me to stay away from her. But still, I told them. My parents saw how worried I was and called the police first thing in the morning. The police went in to investigate the school, but they didn’t find anything\! Harper was nowhere to be seen\! And they also didn’t believe my story\! They thought Harper was playing a prank on me\! It wasn’t until this morning when Harper’s parents finally started to question her disappearance and reported her missing\!

Blake: What do you think happened to her?

Lily: I think… I think the school is actually haunted\!

Blake: Really?

Lily: Yes\! As I said, I don’t know what it was but… I could just sense something wasn’t right with this school when we came here at night. Something that isn’t here during the day, something that isn’t here right now, but it was here then\! Harper thought that was just fear, but I knew it wasn’t that, it was something else\! I don’t know what to do… the police are never going to find her\! They don’t believe my story\! They think Harper is just a delinquent who ran away from home\!

Blake: Lily, we will help you find Harper\!

Ed: We will?

Blake: Yes\! We will\! \*He says with a raised up voice\* You said you felt “something” in this school that isn’t here during the day, correct?

Lily: Yes

Blake: Then, that “thing” must’ve been what kidnapped Lily, and all the other students too\!

Jordan: Huh, nice work detective.

Ed: So what are you saying, that we should come to school at night, find this “thing” and rescue all the students?

Blake: That… is exactly what I’m saying Ed\! I’m glad we’re on the same page\! \*He says with a funny expression. Thumbs up, a wink, and his teeth shining\*

Ed: \*sigh\* alright fine, I’ll come. I’m not expecting to find anything, but, I’ll come.

Jordan: I’ll come too. You guys might need some muscle after all\!

Lily: You’re… you’re really gonna do this? 

Blake: Sure\! I mean, we can’t just sit by and do nothing knowing some “thing” is kidnapping our classmates. Besides, if what you’re saying is true, then the police aren’t going to be of any help. We’ll meet up at school, tonight, at 1 AM.

Lily: Thank you… guys… thank you… I’ll come too\!

Blake: Are you sure?

Lily: Yes\! Harper is my friend… It’s because I was too scared to walk in that she’s been kidnapped… but I won’t run away again\! Harper needs me\!

Blake: Alright then. 1 AM, we’re all meeting up here. Don’t forget it\!
