**Chapter 2 How The Journey Begins Pt 2**

Blake: You know what happened to Harper? Then, why did you say you didn’t know anything when Ms Rose asked?
Lily: Because… she wouldn't believe me! Nobody would!
Blake: I'd believe you! We all would! Right guys?
Ed: Well… I mean...
Jordan: It depends on what she says...
**Blake stares at his friends with an annoyed face**
Blake: ... I'd believe you. So tell me!

**Lily sniffs and agrees to tell them what she knows**

Lily: Ok… *sigh* Here’s what happened. You all know the stories about our school being haunted? Well, around a month ago, a challenge started spreading on social media to visit our school at night. 
Ed: Oh yeah, I've seen that!
Jordan: Me too!
Lily: Well, as soon as people started doing this challenge, something else started to happen, our classmates started disappearing!

**The trio is intrigued**

Lily: The disappearances happening so close with the challenge has only helped fuel the popularity. And well, you know how Harper is. As soon as she heard about this challenge, she wanted to try it. Two days ago, we both came here at midnight. We were going to enter the school together, but… I just… couldn’t… 
Blake: Why not?
Lily: I don’t know… I could just sense something within it, something evil, something… that isn’t usually here... I tried to convince Harper that we shouldn’t go in, but she insisted on doing the challenge. She said she’d go in by herself if I didn’t join her, so she did. And then… after a few minutes… it happened! I heard Harper screaming for help!

**The trio gets shocked**

Jordan: And then you rushed in to rescue her, right?!
Lily: ...
Jordan: What?
Lily: NO! NO I DIDN'T! She was screaming my name! She wanted me to go in! But I… I… I WAS TOO AFRAID TO GO IN!
Blake: Have you told anyone?
Lily: I did! I told my parents! But you know… they don’t like Harper very much, they always tell me to stay away from her. But still, I told them. My parents saw how worried I was and called the police. The police went in to investigate the school, but they didn’t find anything! Harper was nowhere to be seen! I told them my story but they didn't believe it! It wasn’t until this morning when Harper’s parents finally started to question her disappearance and reported her missing!
Ed: Well, what do you think happened to her?
Lily: I think… I think the school is actually haunted!
Ed: Really?
Lily: Yes! As I said, I don’t know what it was but… I could just sense something wasn’t right with this school. Something that isn’t here during the day, something that isn’t here right now, but it was here then! 
Ed: "Something"? What was this "thing"?
Lily: I don't know! But it was there! I could feel it! Harper thought that feeling was just fear, but I knew it wasn’t that, it was something else! I don’t know what to do… the police are never going to find her at this rate! They don’t believe my story at all! They think Harper is just a delinquent girl who ran away from home!
Blake: Lily, we will help you find Harper! *He says with a stoic stare*
Ed: We will?
Blake: Yes! We will! *He says with a raised up voice* 
Blake: Lily, You said you felt “something” in this school that isn’t here during the day, correct?
Lily: Yes
Blake: Then, that “thing” must’ve been what kidnapped Harper, and all the other students too!
Jordan: Oooh, nice going detective. Did you figure that out yourself? *she says with an ironic expression*
Blake: Why are you saying that like I just stated the obvious?!
Ed: Ok so... What are you saying Blake? That we should all come to school at night, find this “thing” and rescue all the students?
Blake: That… is exactly what I’m saying Ed! I’m glad we’re on the same page! *He says with a funny expression. Thumbs up, a wink, and his teeth shining*
Ed: *sigh* I was afraid you would say that. You always like to play the hero. And let me guess, I have to come too-
Blake: You have to come too.
Ed: Fine! I’ll come! I’m not expecting to find anything, but, I’ll come!
Jordan: It goes without saying but, I'll come too!
Ed: Oh good, we might need some muscle.
Jordan: You got a problem with my muscles? *she says while squeezing his head with her hand*
Ed: AW! AW! NO! I DIDN'T SAY THAT! I DIDN'T SAY THAT!
Lily: You’re… you’re really gonna do this? 
Blake: Sure! I mean, we can’t just sit by and do nothing knowing some “thing” is kidnapping our classmates. Besides, if what you’re saying is true, then the police aren’t going to be of any help! 
Lily: Thank you… guys… thank you…
Blake: We’ll meet up at school, tonight, at 12 AM.
Lily: I’ll come too!
Blake: Are you sure?
Lily: Yes! Harper is my friend… It’s because I was too scared to walk in that she’s been kidnapped… but I won’t run away again! Harper needs me!
Blake: Alright then. 12 AM, we’re all meeting up here. Don’t forget it!
