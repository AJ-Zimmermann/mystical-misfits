**Chapter 6**

Blake: So what do you guys think? You think any of this stuff works?

Jordan: I guess there’s only one way to find out.

Blake: Yeah.

Ed: Hey uhm, so assuming that this stuff is real, what do you plan on doing? About the students I mean. Do you really want to go back and fight that Lucius guy?

\*Blake contemplates\*

Blake: I guess I haven’t thought it all the way through… It’s true that Lucius guy is dangerous, but at the same time, I can’t just sit by and ignore this. We have information that no one else has. We might very well be the only people who can stop that guy and rescue the students\! I mean, the police aren’t going to be of any help\!

Ed: But we don’t know what we’re getting into\! Why is it our job to face some psycho magician?

\*Blake clenches his fist\*

Blake: That guy isn’t going to stop Ed. He said it himself, he’s going to keep kidnapping students until he gets what he wants… and we’re the only ones who can stop him\!

Jordan: That’s right\! We can’t just sit by and do nothing\! Not after what we saw\!

Ed: What we saw was a man riding a fucking three-headed demon shooting balls of flame at us\! You’d have to be a literal retard to go back there\!

Jordan: You’re calling me a retard?

Blake: Leave this to me Jordan. Ed, you’re telling me there’s a possibility magick is real and instead of getting excited you’re just gonna… run away and go back to living a normal boring life?

Ed: I like my magick to stay in isekai anime and JRPGs, thank you very much.

Blake: But what about our classmates? Don’t you care about them? Don’t you care about Lily or Harper?

Ed: Maybe a little bit, but I’m not about to risk my life over some thots that wouldn’t even know I exist under normal circumstances.

Blake: Ed-

Ed: Sorry. I’m not going. That’s final.

Blake: Jordan?

Jordan: Let me handle this. \*sigh\* I really didn’t wanna do this… Ed, if you come and help us fight this Lucius guy… I’ll show you my boobs\!

Blake: WHAT?\! Jordan… You… You can’t\!

Jordan: It’s the only way Blake\!

Ed: Sorry, no can do.

Both: WHAT?\!

Ed: I’ve already seen them-... uh…

Blake: What?

Ed: N-Nothing… Uhh anyways the point is, I’m not goi-

Jordan: What do you mean “you’ve already seen them”? I’ve never shown you my boobs\!

Ed: I-I-I-It means nothing\!

Jordan: Ed you’re a terrible liar. We know you’re hiding something, spill it\!

\*Ed shifts his eyes nervously\*

Jordan: NOW\!

Ed: O-Ok\! Ok\! Remember our sleep over last summer? How we stole my parent’s beers and drank them all at Blake’s house?

Jordan: Yeeeeaaaah

Ed: Well… Some time during the night, while you were both passed out, I got up to pee, and when I came back, I noticed your bra was falling off, so I… I…  
\*scene showing Ed purposefully pulling down Jordan’s bra so he can see her boobs\*

Ed: Man… I just can’t get turned on by you…

Ed: So… yeah… that’s what happened… I didn’t get turned on by you Jordan, but I tried\! I really tried\! Hope that clears… it… up…

\*Jordan is seething, then puts on a passive aggressive smile\*

Jordan: Alright Ed, new deal\! Come help us defeat Lucius… AND YOUR HEAD WON’T BE HANGING FROM A POWER LINE\!

\*Ed squeals\*

Ed: OK\! OK\! I’ll GO\! I’ll GO\!

Jordan: \*Sigh\* Good news Blake\! Ed is on board\!

Blake: Yeah… I saw that…

Ed: Man this is so fucking bullshit.
