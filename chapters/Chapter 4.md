**Chapter 4**

Lily: You… You kidnapped Harper?... WHY?\!

Lucius: It’s bait

Lily: BAIT?\! BAIT FOR WHAT?\!

Lucius: Before I tell you, I’ll ask you the same thing I’ve asked all the others. Are any of you the magician I felt in this school?

Blake: Huh? What are you talking about?

Lucius: \*Sigh\* figures… One month ago, as I was traveling through this town, I sensed an insane amount of magick coming from this very school. I knew that such power could only be coming from another magician, so I barged into this school to challenge whoever that was to a duel, but almost as soon as I came in, the presence disappeared. It was summer but there were some cars parked outside, so there were definitely some people here\! I was determined to get whoever that was to come back here and challenge me, and that is when I came up a plan. I started spreading a challenge on Twitter-

Ed: Errm, It’s called X now.

Lucius: Right. X... As I was saying, I started spreading a challenge on… X, to visit the school at night. I ask the people who show up if they were the magician, and if they’re not, I kidnap them\! And I plan on keeping this up until whoever that magician was takes the hint and comes back here to duel me\! But so far, whoever that was hasn’t shown up…

Lily: You… YOU STARTED THE CHALLENGE?\!

Lucius: Indeed\!

\*Lily slowly walks towards Lucius but Jordan stops her\*

Jordan: Don’t Lily\! You’re no match for him\!

Lucius: Yeah “Lily”\! Listen to your boyfriend\!

Jordan: THE FUCK DID YOU JUST CALL ME?\! Oh now you’re gonna get it\! 

\*gets in a fighting stance\*

\*Blake stops Jordan\*

Lucius: Well, if none of you are the magician, then I’ll just capture you all\!

\*Lucius commands \*\*\*\*\* to grab them\*

\*Jordan delivers a powerful blow to \*\*\*\*\*

Lucius: What? I’ve never seen anyone defeat my demons by punching them\!

Jordan: Your demons are no match for me\!

Lucius: Oh? Getting cocky are we? Well if it’s a fight you want, then it’s a fight you’ll get\!

\*Lucius commands cerberus to fire at Jordan\*

\*Blake heroically jumps in front of Jordan to protect her. He then instinctively blocks the flame attack, managing to swing it away\*

Lucius: What? How did you?... Alright, let’s try something else. \*Lucius uses a spell invoking a demon\*

\*Blake somehow casts a circle of protection. It will be revealed later that Gardner predicted this fight would happen and casted it himself beforehand.\*

Ed: Woah\! What is this?\!

Lucius: Huh? T-That’s… That’s a protection circle\! But how? He didn’t even cast a spell\! Could this kid have really been the source of that magick? No, that’s impossible\! That said…

Lucius: I’ll tell you what, I’m gonna let you guys go.

Everyone: Huh?\!

Lucius: I’m letting you go for now… but\! You will come back here at the same time, one month from now, and you will fight me in a duel\!

Blake: What are you talking about?

Lucius: You blocked my attacks, kid, that’s not something anyone can do. It would be a waste to just kill you right now. I’m giving you one month to hone in on your craft and fight me like a magician. If you can defeat me in a duel, I’ll release all your classmates\! And, just so you don’t even think about ditching our duel, I’m taking this one with me\!

Lily: GUYS\! HELP ME- 

Everyone: LILY\!\!\!\!

Jordan: Fuck\! He must’ve grabbed her while we were distracted\!

Lucius: One month from now\! Don’t forget it\!

Blake: Hey wait\!

\*Blake runs towards Lucius\*

Lucius: So long\!

\*Lucius disappears back into the shadow\*

Blake: He’s gone…
