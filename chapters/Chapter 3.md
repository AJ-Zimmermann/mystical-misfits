**Chapter 3**

**Chapter begins with a shot of Ed showing up breathless on his bike**
Blake: Jeez, you took your sweet time!
Ed: Yeah, because you refused to give me a ride! You know it takes me 45 minutes to get here biking!
Blake: Hey man, gas prices are high right now, I gotta save every last drop.
Ed: But why do you give her a ride!?
Jordan: Because I live right next to him! He doesn't have to pick me up, I just walk to his house!
Blake: You know Ed, if you just got a driver’s license you wouldn’t have this problem anymore.
Ed: Chhh. Even if I got one, my mom wouldn’t let me use her car.
Blake: Then buy a car!
Ed: Oh yeah like I can afford that!
Blake: Hey why are you yelling at me? I’m just trying to give you advice!
Ed: Oh are you? Because from the sarcastic tone of your voice, it sounds like you’re just trying to annoy me!
Lily: H-Hello? 
**A shot of Lily’s silhouette walking towards them**
Blake: Oh, Lily, you’re here!
Ed: Wait, if she showed up right now, then why were you angry at me for... oh forget it.

**The gang gets together**
Blake: So we’re all here. Do you sense that “thing” coming from the school, Lily?
Lily: I do…

**Blake stares at the school for a few seconds, contemplating whether they really should go in or not**
Lily: Is there a problem?
Blake: No, it’s nothing. Well then, let’s go in.

**A shot of the gang walking into the school**
**A shot of the gang walking through the school’s hallways**

Ed: Being in school after dark makes you feel weird, doesn’t it?
Lily: Yeah, I know what you mean.
Jordan: Heh, you two getting scared already?
Ed: No I'm not scared! It's just weird being in school at night!
Jordan: That sounds like being scared to me!
Blake: You know I could probably take a picture of these hallways and get over 10 thousand updoots on r/liminalspace
Ed: That's it! We're in a liminal space!
Jordan: Reddit? Liminal spaces? This is why you two are still virgins you know. 
Ed: Fuuuuuck youuuuuu
Jordan: Aww did I hurt your little virgin feelings? Virgin?
Ed: Making fun of my virginity... Be worse if you made fun of my height...
Jordan: Huh? Did you say something? You might need to speak up so your voice can reach me!
Ed: That's it *Ed raises his fist at Jordan*
Jordan: Oh what? What? You're gonna punch me? Is that what you're gonna do? Huh? *her face shows she doesn't feel threatened by Ed*
Ed: maybe....
Blake: Knock it off you two! We're on a mission here! We're searching for some "thing", entity unkown, that kidnapped our classmates, and is likely dangerous!
Ed: Pshhh, as if we're actually gonna find anythi- uhhh, guys? Did this mirror always do this?
Blake: Do what?
Ed: S-Show your reflection as a big horrifying monster!
Blake: What are you talking about?
Ed: Ugh, just, come over here and look! Look! Look! Look! See? Eh?
Blake: Oooooh yeah you’re right! That IS a horrifying monster! *laughs*
Ed: Grrrrr no I’m serious! It was JUST showing me, as this, this, this big monster with *begins describing the monster*
*the gang stops laughing when they see the monster sneaking up behind him*  
Everyone: Ah!
Ed: What? *sigh* He’s right behind me, isn’t he? *ACK!* DUDE WHAT THE FUCK? HE REALLY WAS RIGHT BEHIND ME!  
Everyone: ED!
*Jordan rushes in and kicks the demon in the face, causing it to drop Ed*
Ed: Thanks Jorda- WOAH!  
*The demon tries to attack them but Jordan dashes them out of the way*
Jordan: Don’t mention it!
Lucius: Hmm? Not bad. You’re quite strong, aren’t you? *he says from the shadows*
Blake: Who’s there? Show yourself!
Lucius: Unfortunately, sheer strength alone won’t be enough to defeat me.
*A ball of flame shoots out from the shadow where the voice is coming from, going straight to Jordan*
*Jordan dodges the ball*
Lucius: Nice dodge! But simply dodging my attacks won’t be enough!
Blake: Hey? Didn’t you hear me? Show yourself!
Lucius: Well, since you asked nicely.
*Lucius finally steps out of the shadow and reveals himself*
*The gang is shocked upon seeing a man riding a devil*
Ed: Wh-wh-wh-wh-WHO ARE YOU?!?!?! *Ed says in a scared voice*
Lucius: Hmm, I guess I should introduce myself. I am Lucius Grimwood! Otherwise known as Lucius “The Malevolent”!
Blake: Lucius The Malevolent?
Lucius: That’s right! Lucius is my real name, The Malevolent is my magician name. Pretty cool, right?
Blake: Magician? Hey wait, are you the one who’s been kidnapping our classmates?
*Lucius grins silently for a few seconds*
Lucius: And what if I am? What will you do about it?
Blake: ANSWER ME!
Lucius: Oh my, you're quite serious aren't you? Yes, it's me! I kidnapped your classmates!
*Chapter ends with a shot of the gang’s shocked expression*
