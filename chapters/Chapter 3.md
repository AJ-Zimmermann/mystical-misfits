**Chapter 3**

\*Chapter begins with a shot of Ed showing up breathless on his bike\*

Blake: Jeez, you took your sweet time\!

Ed: Yeah, because you refused to give me a ride\! You know it takes me 45 minutes to get here biking\!

Blake: Hey man, gas prices are high right now, I gotta save every last drop.

Ed: But why did you give her a ride\!?

Jordan: Because I live right next to him\! He didn’t have to pick me up, I just walked to his house.

Blake: You know Ed, if you just got a driver’s license you wouldn’t have this problem anymore.

Ed: Chhh. Even if I got one, my mom wouldn’t let me use her car to drive wherever I wanted.

Blake: Then buy a car\!

Ed: Oh yeah like I can afford that\!

Blake: Hey why are you yelling at me? I’m just trying to help\!

Ed: Oh are you? Because from the sarcastic tone of your voice, it sounds like you’re just trying to annoy me\!

Lily: H-Hello? 

\*A shot of Lily’s silhouette walking towards them\*

Blake: Oh, Lily, you’re here\!

Ed: Wait, if she showed up right now, then why were you angry at me for... oh forget it.

\*The gang gets together\*

Blake: So we’re all here. Do you sense that “thing” coming from the school, Lily?

Lily: I do…

\*Blake stares at the school for a few seconds, contemplating whether they really should go in or not\*

Lily: Is there a problem?

Blake: No, it’s nothing. Well then, let’s go in.

\*The gang nods their head\*

\*A shot of the gang walking through the school’s hallways\*

Ed: Being in school after dark makes you feel weird, doesn’t it?

Lily: Yeah, I know what you mean.

Jordan: Heh, you two getting scared already?

Ed: No it’s not that\! It’s, you know, the liminal spaces thing.

Jordan: \*groans\* my youtube feed still recommends me videos about that\! It was kinda cool at first but all those youtubers and redditors ran it to the ground\!

Ed: Hey hey\! I’m not a redditor\!

Jordan: I didn’t say you were\!

Blake: I wanna stick my dick in a liminal space.

Ed: Huh?

Blake: B-Because a liminal is like a space between two things, right? So I want to stick my dick in the space between two…

Ed: Ohh I get it\! Yeah, that was really lame. Never make another joke again\!

Blake: Oh like you could do better.

Ed: I could definitely make a better jo- uhhh, guys? Did this mirror always do this?

Blake: Do what?

Ed: S-Show your reflection as a big horrifying monster\!

Blake: What are you talking about?

Ed: Ugh, just, come over here and look\! Look\! Look\! Look\! See? Eh?

Blake: Oooooh yeah you’re right\! That IS a horrifying monster\! \*laughs\*

Ed: Grrrrr no I’m serious\! It was JUST showing me, as this, this, this big monster with \*begins describing the monster\*

\*the gang stops laughing when they see the monster sneaking up behind him\*  
Everyone: Ah\!

Ed: What? \*sigh\* He’s right behind me, isn’t he? \*ACK\!\* DUDE WHAT THE FUCK? HE REALLY WAS RIGHT BEHIND ME\!  
Everyone: ED\!

\*Jordan rushes in and kicks the demon in the face, causing it to drop Ed\*

Ed: Thanks Jorda- WOAH\!  
\*The demon tries to attack them but Jordan dashes them out of the way\*

Jordan: Don’t mention it\!

Lucius: Hmm? Not bad. You’re quite strong, aren’t you? \*he says from the shadows\*

Blake: Who’s there? Show yourself\!

Lucius: Unfortunately, sheer strength alone won’t be enough to defeat me.

\*A ball of flame shoots out from the shadow where the voice is coming from, going straight to Jordan\*

\*Jordan dodges the ball\*

Lucius: Nice dodge\! But simply dodging my attacks won’t be enough\!

Blake: Hey? Didn’t you hear me? Show yourself\!

Lucius: Well, since you asked nicely.

\*Lucius finally steps out of the shadow and reveals himself\*

\*The gang is shocked upon seeing a man riding a devil\*

Ed: Wh-wh-wh-wh-WHO ARE YOU?\!?\!?\! \*Ed says in a scared voice\*

Lucius: Hmm, I guess I should introduce myself. I am Lucius Grimwood\! Otherwise known as Lucius “The Malevolent”\!

Blake: Lucius The Malevolent?

Lucius: That’s right\! Lucius is my real name, The Malevolent is my magician name. Pretty cool, right?

Blake: Magician? Hey wait, are you the one who’s been kidnapping our classmates?

Lucius: Hm, so you figured it out? Well, yes, to answer your question, that’s right\! It is me\! I’m the one who kidnapped your classmates\!
